# Contributing to MCI

MCI is a working paper, not a finished specification. Contributions that challenge, refine, or extend the pattern are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### Challenge a Position

If you disagree with an architectural position, open an issue with:
- Which position you're challenging
- Your alternative view
- Any evidence or experience supporting your position

Disagreement is valuable. The goal is better answers, not defending current ones.

### Share Implementation Experience

If you've built something similar or tried these patterns:
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What's missing?

Open an issue or submit a PR.

### Propose Refinements

The rubrics (SCALE, CLASSic application) are starting points. Ideas welcome for:
- Additional dimensions
- Better scoring methods
- Different weightings
- Edge cases not covered

## What We're Not Looking For

- Marketing or promotional content
- Vendor-specific implementations without clear architectural lessons
- Changes that make the pattern less opinionated (the opinions are the point)

## Process

1. Open an issue first for significant changes
2. Keep PRs focused
3. Expect discussion

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Assume good faith. Focus on ideas, not people.
